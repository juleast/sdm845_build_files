To run the script please place it in the rom dir. Then you have to allow it to be executed, use the command: chmod +x rom.sh and to execute it use: bash rom.sh. When you are asked for new rom prefix check in github source what prefix they have by checking vendor_{prefix} repo, for example on EvolutionX its gonna be vendor_evolution so we use "evolution" prefix.
